## SSG, SSR, CSR and ISR

### SSG - Static Site Generation

**Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

* Marketing pages
* Blog posts
* E-commerce product listings
* Help and documentation

### SSR - Server-side Rendering

**Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate frequently updated data.

### CSR - Client-side Rendering

### ISR - Incremental Static Regeneration
